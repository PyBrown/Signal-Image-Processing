# Signal/Image Processing
Signal/Image processing techniques applied to subsurface data. 

This repository contains notebooks on various signal/image processing techniques applied to subsurface geoscience data. The methods are applied to generate features for machine learning tasks. Join me on my journey into learning signal/image processing in python.
