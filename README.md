# Signal-Image-Processing
Signal/Image processing techniques applied to subsurface data 

This repository will contain notebooks on an introduction to the application of various signal/image processing techniques to subsurface geoscience data. Ultimately, the methods will be applied to generate features for machine learning tasks. Join me on my journey into learning signal/image processing in python.
